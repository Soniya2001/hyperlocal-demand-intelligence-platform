# OneMindAI – Hyperlocal Demand Intelligence Platform

OneMindAI is an AI-powered platform that helps retail sellers identify slow-moving inventory and match it with nearby demand using hyperlocal intelligence.

The solution uses AI-based demand forecasting and inventory classification to generate actionable redistribution recommendations, enabling seller-to-seller matching with local pickup. It is designed for small sellers in rural and semi-urban markets and focuses on non-perishable retail categories.

This repository contains design and documentation for the **Phase 1 idea submission** of the AWS AI for Bharat Hackathon.
